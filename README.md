# SAGE300_WEBAPI_Samples-PHP-
Just a few Sage 300 WEP API examples using PHP and CURL

For these samples to work you need to setup a Sage ERP 300 Sample company (SAMINC).
The instructions for this can be followed from the official Sage 300 installation guides. Sage300 and WEB-API must be installed.

Setup a new user:WEBAPI with a password:WEBAPI and make sure the WEBAPI user has read/write web api access in the permission 
setup for the sage modules. IE AR, OE ect ect.

Some notes:
These samples do not query all web-api enpoints mostly because in principal the method used to query the API is the same.
I specifically selected and created samples that should cover all scenarios.
